This proposal will help produce healthy crops and possibly extra income. By using the scientific method this experiment can be proved and tested. We will be conducting an experiment analyzing how fruit peel compost affects the height, and number of leaves of Raphanus sativus. Towards communities and the environment fruit peel composting is valuable because of its multiple benefits to the environment and to the community. From the data I gathered, these fruit peels have nutrients like potash, iron, zinc, calcium, citrate content etc. In addition to this, Fruit peels are also high in both macro and micro nutrients which promote plant growth. Humans could reduce the waste load and receive more advantages than inorganic fertilizer by using fruit peel as fertilizer. In brief,  fruit peel composting is a great way to benefit you, your community and the environment without having to spend money.

SMAC can benefit from this as fruit peel compost can be used as a fertilizer by SMAC and plant vegetables. This can also help them lessen expenses and produce extra money by selling the fertilizer itself. The vegetables they have grown can be sold in local markets or online. In the process of making fruit peel composition, it won't cost the institution anything at all as they can use their fruit peels to make the compost, and it can be easily found and done. Research shows that garden activities such as composting can help give peace to one's mind, which can also help distract the children from personal problems and trauma from neglect and abandonment. From what we have gathered children in SMAC are in need of professional help for their mental health, thus, gardening activities such as composting and planting can somewhat help lessen and/or forget about their problems for a while
