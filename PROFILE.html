Observe the poor parishioners' living situations and the families who are unable to take care of sick members. Youth who are unable to attend school due to financial constraints, walking in the streets in large numbers. These people were rounded up by SMAC and given homes. The goal of SMAC is to locate street children who have been left or abandoned, provide them with the chance to better their life through knowledge, and give them a place to call home where they may experience love and care.

<p>
Madre Nanda Giamberardini, the institution's mother and founder, founded the group with the intention of offering high-quality assistance to neglected, abandoned, and orphaned children living on the streets. Facilities like providing medical and wellness care, teaching fundamental skills like baking and cooking, and providing spiritual uplift through participation in rosaries and the holy eucharist are all examples of service. The center's founder wanted to raise the quality of service offered to those children by realigning the programs and concretizing its offers and to prepare the center for independence.
