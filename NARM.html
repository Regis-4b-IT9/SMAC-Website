From the analysis done on the resources, the SMAC sister's institution needs funding for the medical care of the children. From what has been gathered, SMAC has tried to make Ten children undergo therapy since they have known how the abandonment and harsh environment have affected the children's mental health, due to financial problems, unfortunately only one of the children was able to finish the sessions. 
<br> 
<br>
As a group we will be able to contribute to volunteer findings, asking for donations, and connections. We can make websites/articles, posters and infographics about SMAC Sisters and ask for donations for fundings specifically medical fundings. Volunteers for medical assistance example dental check ups, basic check ups, and phycological help/check ups, we can also widen the connection of SMAC as we spread the news to family and friends which may be helpful in finding help. 
<br>
<br>
This will not only help the children but also help our society, as children of different ages are discarded or thrown away which increases the chances of them being abused and turned into prostitutes, killed, and/or human trafficked which affects the living environment in a country, as well as the futures of these discarded and abused children. This proposal will not only help the institution but also help other institutions and children who are currently roaming around the streets and doesn't have a safe blanket, this proposal will be able to help not just AdDUs partner institutions but others as well as we will be publishing articles that does not only focus on SMAC but the abandoned and neglected children as well

The SMAC Sisters took over the CARITAS and served the Parish of Toril after arriving in Davao City on January 17, 1998. Observing the living conditions of the poor parishioners and families who are unable to treat sick members; the existence of out-of-school kids due to financial inability resulting in the majority of them to wander on the streets; very poor living conditions resulting in malnutrition, lacking in hygiene, and low morale; extreme poverty; and factors that influence for the children to be exposed to violence and sexual mistreatment. SMAC gathered these youth and gave them food. The goal of SMAC is to locate children who have been abandoned or orphaned on the streets and give them an opportunity to improve their lives with education and give them a shelter to live in.

The typical issues/concerns that the SMAC Sisters community may face include the living conditions of the poor parishioners and families who are unable to treat sick members; the presence of out-of-school children due to economic inability, causing the majority of them to wander on the streets; very poor living conditions leading to malnutrition, lacking in hygiene, and low morale; extreme poverty; and factors that contribute to the exposure of the children to v These findings prompted the SMAC to assemble those kids and give them a place to live. The kids also require psychological evaluations, but we are unable to pay for them since they are too expensive. Not only for one session, but for as long as it takes the child to fully recovers and will become mindful about all his/ her issues
</p>

<p>
The SMAC sisters community is a non profit organization which helps children in need and has been in Davao for a long time. Besides giving a shelter for the children, they feed them, give them the affection they need, teach them livelihood skills and academics. The SMAC's vision is to  produce Socially adjusted and psychologically developed children, spiritually mature, living and practicing Christian values, sharing their faith with their peers, and enjoying the fullness of life. While their vision is to Seek out the neglected, abandoned, and orphaned children in the streets, allow them to improve their lives through education; giving them a home where they can feel love and care, receive spiritual and values formation to nurture and strengthen their integral human development. I find the facts I stated above to be important since it gives you the meaning behind the creation of the SMAC and its purpose.

Our geometry learnings helped us in our ET 3 as a problem-solver as it helped us be able to read and analyze  the situation easier as well as make out an effective method and plan in order to fix the problems we may have such as the lack of funding in the organization for the children's use and the sisters for schooling and health related issues and how we may be able to counter it with the use of volunteers and as well as funding projects and donors. So from our geometry learnings we are able to see through the problems as well as give good ideas and methods in order to solve them. Studying geometry provides many foundational skills and helps to build the thinking skills of logic, deductive reasoning, analytical reasoning, and problem-solving.

As an Atenean I'm taught to have great values, to serve others, and cura personalis. Being a helping hand in a way of helping SMAC take-in/locate children you see in the streets, abandoned and giving donations to SMAC Sisters for additional funds(+63 991 308 4872 - Sir Luz of SMAC Sisters). Having knowledge about orphanage that are in need of help towards funds for children and being able to help solve those problems by charity, volunteers for fundraising/medical assistance/educational assistance can greatly help the community/surroundings be better since children in the streets are now given a home and proper knowledge (education and basic life skills)
