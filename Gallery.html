George Aldolphus Storey - Orphans 1879<br>
During the nineteenth century there was widespread concern for the plight of homeless and destitute children. One of the few caring institutions and almost the only one to support illegitimate children, was the Foundling Hospital. This had been established in 1739 by Thomas Coram, a sea captain, and the first Hospital was built in 1745 in Lamb's Conduit Fields. Its many patrons included George Frederick Handel, Thomas Gainsborough and William Hogarth. The boys were trained as apprentices to a trade or encouraged to join the army as band boys and the girls were taught domestic skills to fit them for work as maids. Until the mid-1870s, such institutions held orphan or charity 'elections' in which candidates were given places based on how much money and votes they received from affluent patrons. In the 1870s various asylums for girls were being established, the first of these was Dr. Barnardo's first home for girls, opened in London in 1873.

Thomas Benjamin Kennington-Orphans 1885<br>
Kennington was one of the founder members of the New English Art Club in 1886, and its first Secretary. He was well known for his compelling pictures of the urban poor, although he also painted less emotive scenes from everyday life, and portraits. The rich colouring, smooth handling of paint, and subject were probably inspired by the work of the seventeenth-century Spanish artist Murillo, who also painted poor children.

Andrew Q. Fernandez-The Karomata<br>
Many poor Filipinos rely much on the use of karomata, a three-wheeled cart used by many families living in slums to carry their goods they collected from garbages. This image shows a father feeds his kids after selling empty bottles at a peso per piece.
